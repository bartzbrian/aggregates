# aggregates

Python code for my undergraduate thesis art installation project at Reed College. More info can be found here:

This code also requires the dlib shape predictor file to run. It can be found here:

Thank you to the learnopencv.com page and Dr. Satya Mallick for the code which averaged together images of faces.
